# Welcome to C Firth!
**Firth** is an experimental programming language heavily inspired by Forth.
Its goals are to be small, fast and efficient, portable and embeddable.

Note that this is the C version of Firth. There is also an earlier C++ version
available [here](https://github.com/mseminatore/firth). The main differences
between the two versions are:

* This version is written in C
* The C version uses a traditional linked list dictionary
* The C version uses subroutine threading vs. bytecode interpreter

I created **Firth** primarily as an exercise in learning Forth. And also to 
have my own environment for experimentation. The original plan was to create 
a simple Forth system, written in C++. However, along the way I realized that 
there were some things about Forth that I probably wanted to change. Mainly 
small things to modernize the syntax to make it a little bit easier for 
beginners. That said, Firth remains largely Forth compatible.

Rather than create a version of Forth that might not be compatible with 
existing Forth code, it seemed a better idea to make a language heavily 
influenced by, and largely compatible with Forth. While still retaining the 
option to break basic Forth compatibility when and where that made sense.

## Basics of the Firth language

In **Firth**, as in Forth, there are really only two key concepts. There are `Numbers` 
and there are `Words`.

### Numbers

Everything that is not a `Word` is a `Number`. Numbers largely live on the stack. 
When you type a number Firth pushes it onto the stack. Parameters (or arguments) 
to words are usually passed on the stack. The result of a word is usually placed 
on the stack.

Arithmetic in Firth, as in Forth, uses Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). To add two
numbers together you would write:

```Forth
Firth> 1 2 +
  ok

Firth> .S
Top -> [ 3 ] 
  ok
```

This code pushes the number 1 and then the number 2 onto the stack. And then it 
adds those two numbers together, replacing them with the result on the 
stack. The built-in `Word` called `.S` prints out, without modifying, the 
contents of the stack.

### Words

`Words` are really just another name for functions. In **Firth** it is very easy to create new 
`Words`. Let's create a `Word` for addition. To do so looks like this:

```Forth
Firth> func add + ;
  ok

Firth> 1 2 add
  ok

Firth> print
3  ok
```

This code creates a new `Word` named `add` that calls `+` to add the top two stack 
entries and put the result on the stack. The built-in `Word` called `print` 
prints the top of stack.

### Firth Examples

Below are a few examples of Firth in action. First, the canonical hello world 
program.

```Forth
Firth> func hello ." Hello World! " ;
  ok

Firth> hello
Hello World!
  ok
```

Next, we define a new `Word` called `fibonacci` that computes the Fibonacci sequence 
for the number currently on the stack.

```Forth
Firth> func fibonacci DUP
    0<> IF DUP 1 
            <> IF
                0 1 ROT 1- 0 FOR DUP ROT + LOOP NIP
            ENDIF
        ENDIF
;
  ok

Firth> 9 fibonacci PRINT
34  ok
```

### From Forth to Firth

You may be asking, where does Firth diverge from Forth? In nearly all cases
I've added "syntactic sugar" to modernize the feel of the code. These are
implemented as `Word` synonyms. You can stick with Forth syntax if you prefer.
Or you can migrate to the more modern Firth syntax when and as you wish.

Here are the word synonyms that Firth offers: 

Firth | Forth | Comments
----- | ----- | --------
VAR | VARIABLE | The keyword `var` is pretty common in modern languages
CONST | CONSTANT | The use of `const` is also pretty common
FUNC | : | Colon seems obscure for a modern function declaration
ENDIF | THEN | I prefer IF-ELSE-ENDIF to the Forth IF-ELSE-THEN construct
FOR | DO | The `limit` and `index` make this is a FOR loop by modern standards
ALLOC | ALLOT | Alloc seems more modern for allocating space for memory cells

At the moment I prefer `func` as a colon synonym. It is short yet descriptive,
which seems to be in the spirit of Forth word naming. So that is what I've 
documented here.

That said, I am still actively debating whether to use the Rust `fn`, 
Swift's `func`, Javascript's `function` or Python's `def` as a replacement 
for `:`. For now they all exist to see which feels better. If you have strong 
opinions please let me know. You can configure the defaults in 
*firth_config.h*.

### Embedding Firth

Firth is designed to be very easy to embed into other apps. Doing so requires
integration of one .c and one .h file (firth.c and firth.h) and just a few
Firth API calls. Adding in optional floating point support words involves one 
additional API call and one more .c file (firth_float.c).

The file *main.c* demonstrates how to initialize Firth and add custom
`Words` for a constant, a variable, and a native function. The important excerpts
of *main.c* are shown below.

```C++

#include "firth.h"

// custom word functions
static int isEven(Firth *pFirth)
{
	FirthNumber n = fth_pop(pFirth);
	fth_push(pFirth, (n % 2) == 0 ? FTH_TRUE : FTH_FALSE);

	return FTH_TRUE;
}

static int isOdd(Firth *pFirth)
{
	FirthNumber n = fth_pop(pFirth);
	fth_push(pFirth, (n % 2) ? FTH_TRUE : FTH_FALSE);

	return FTH_TRUE;
}

// register our collection of custom words
static const FirthWordSet myWords[] =
{
	{ "even?", isEven },
	{ "odd?", isOdd },
	{ NULL, NULL }
};

// examples of calling Firth from native code
void callFirth(Firth *pFirth)
{
        // fth_exec_word is a set of convenience methods to push 
        // 1, 2, or 3 parameters on stack and execute a word
        fth_exec_word2(pFirth, "+", 1, 2);

        // execute any defined word, no passed parameters
        fth_exec_word(pFirth, ".");

        // parse and execute a line of text
        fth_parse_string(pFirth, "CP @ .");
}

int main()
{
        // create a new Firth state object
	pFirth = fth_create_state();

	// use our output function
	fth_set_output_function(pFirth, myPrint);

	banner(pFirth);

	// REPL loop
	while (!pFirth->halted)
	{
		fth_update(pFirth);
	}

	// we're done, cleanup and quit
	fth_delete_state(pFirth);

	return 0;
}

```

### Testing Firth

I have created a small test harness to allow testing words in Firth. This
framework is called *test.fth* and is located in the **test** sub-folder. You
load the framework as follows:

```Forth
Firth> include test\test.fth
  ok

```

I have also created a set of unit tests for the core Firth `Words`. The unit 
tests are also found in the **test** sub-folder in a file called 
*core-tests.fth*. Once again you load the tests by including the file. 

> I found that having unit tests was critical to the development of this 
> project. It allowed me to ensure that newly added words functioned correctly.
> But even more importantly, having a rich set of unit tests allowed me to 
> re-factor and optimize code with confidence.

The *core-tests.fth* file both defines and runs the unit tests. If all goes well a message will be 
displayed saying that *All tests passed!*

### Configuring Firth

Firth is designed to be somewhat configurable. Configuration parameters are
adjusted by editing the file *firth_config.h* and rebuilding Firth. The
parameters are:

Name | Description
---- | -----------
FTH_UNDEFINED | The value placed in memory for uninitialized variables
FTH_CASE_SENSITIVE | Controls compiler case sensitivity
FTH_INCLUDE_FLOAT | Controls whether floating point is compiled into Firth
FTH_MAX_WORD_NAME | Sets the limit for the length of a word name
FTH_DEFAULT_DATA_SEGMENT_SIZE | Sets the default size reserved for variables
FTH_MAX_PRINTF_SIZE | Sets the limit for the length of a firth_printf result
FTH_EPSILON | Defines epsilon for floating point precision

### Floating point support

Forth traditionally does not include support for floating point. Firth by 
default *does* include primitive floating point support, adding a floating
point number stack, float variables and load/store operations. 

> If memory space is at a premium and you do not need or want floating point 
> support you can edit the file *firth_config.h* to remove it.

By also including the files *firth_float.c* and *firth_float.h* you can
install a set of floating point support words.

```C++
    #include "firth.h"
    #include "firth_float.h"
    ...
    FirthFloat fSimTime;

    // create a float const and var
    fth_define_word_fconst(pFirth, "PI", 3.1415926);
    fth_define_word_fvar(pFirth, "SimTime", &fSimTime);

```

Below is a list of the additional words that the floating point library 
includes. In the listing below TOFS represents the top of float stack.

Word | Description | Stack effects
---- | ----------- | -------------
F+ | float addition | ( f: n1 n2 -- n1+n2 )
F- | float subtraction | ( f: n1 n2 -- n1-n2 )
F* | float multiplication | ( f: n1 n2 -- n1*n2 )
F/ | float division | ( f: n1 n2 -- n1/n2 )
F. | print TOFS | ( f: n -- )
F@ | fetch a float variable |  ( s: addr -- f: n )
F! | store a float variable | ( f: n s: addr -- )
F< | less than comparison | ( f: n1 n2 -- s: f )
F\> | greater than comparison | ( f: n1 n2 -- s: f )
F= | equivalence comparison | ( f: n1 n2 -- s: f )
F<> | not equivalence comparison | ( f: n1 n2 -- s: f )
FABS | absolute value of TOFS | ( f: n -- abs(n) )
FCONST | define a new float constant | ( f: n -- )
COS | cos of TOFS | ( f: n -- cos(n) )
FDEPTH | put depth of float stack on data stack | ( s: -- n )
FDROP | drop the TOFS | ( f: n -- )
FDUP | duplicate the TOFS | ( f: n -- n n )
FEXP | exp of TOFS | ( f: n -- exp(n) )
FLN | natural log of TOFS | ( f: n -- log(n) )
FNIP | discard the second entry on stack | ( f: n1 n2 -- n2 )
FOVER | copy the second stack entry to the top | ( f: n1 n2 -- n1 n2 n1 )
FROT | rotate the top 3 stack entries | ( f: n1 n2 n3 -- n2 n3 n1 )
SIN | sin of TOFS | ( f: n -- sin(n) )
TAN | tan of TOFS | ( f: n -- tan(n) )
FTUCK | copy the top stack item below the second stack item | ( f: n1 n2 -- n2 n1 n2)
SQRT | square root of TOFS | ( f: n -- sqrt(n) )
FSWAP | swap the top two float stack entries | ( f: n1 n2 -- n2 n1 )
FVAR | define a new float variable | ( f: -- )
\.F | non-destructively print the float stack contents | ( f: -- )
